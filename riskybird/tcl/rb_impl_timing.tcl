# Place and route an already-synthesized checkpoint, then report timing and power.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: `rb area` is synthesis-only, so it answers "does it fit" and
# says nothing about whether the design closes at its target frequency. The
# missing evidence is post-route: achieved F_max, worst negative slack, and
# power.
#
# WHY IT STARTS FROM A CHECKPOINT rather than re-running the whole flow. The
# area flow measures RTL that has had `use_dsp` attributes injected into
# gen-collateral, and that injection is a working-tree edit undone by the next
# elaboration. Re-running `make bitstream` re-elaborates, discards the
# injection, and would route a different design from the one whose utilization
# was recorded. Opening `obj/post_synth.dcp` instead routes exactly the netlist
# that was measured -- the attributes are already baked into it -- and skips
# synthesis, which is most of the runtime.
#
# Report filenames match what `rb area timing` reads: timing.txt and clocks.txt.
#
# Usage, from the fpga directory:
#   vivado -nojournal -mode batch -source riskybird/tcl/rb_impl_timing.tcl \
#          -tclargs -checkpoint <path/to/post_synth.dcp>
